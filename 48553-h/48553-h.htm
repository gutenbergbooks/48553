<h2><span class="smcap">Preface.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Editor of the following pages has no desire to offer them in competition with the
numerous and useful Handbooks on Illumination already published. All those that
the writer has met with&mdash;some eight or ten&mdash;have been almost exclusively directed to the
study of Missal Painting and Illuminating on the most <i>minute</i> scale. The exceptions to this
rule are a few occasional remarks, merely hinting at the larger and more popular style.</p>

<p>The principal omission, however, which this little book is designed to supply, is the
<i>emblematic</i> branch of the subject. Amateurs most generally confine themselves to illuminating
texts of Holy Scripture on a large scale, to assist in which numerous printed outlines are
now published. But, from complete ignorance of the rules of ecclesiastical colouring, the
amateur not only becomes hopelessly bewildered as to what colour to select for particular
words, but, in falling back upon his own taste for guidance, commits errors which destroy
the emblematic beauty of his work. The significance of colour is greater than is generally
supposed, and will be found a subject of much interest.</p>

<p>Such sacred symbols as could easily be introduced into illuminated scrolls have been
described, in the hope that, by their assistance, a taste for strictly appropriate ornamentation
may be more largely cultivated, to the exclusion of those unmeaning and tawdry decorations
which offend the eye.</p>

<p>Instead of furnishing copies of antique capitals, of which so many excellent collections
now abound, it has been thought more useful to supply the reader with some specimens of
emblematic letters (which may suggest other similar designs), suitable for particular texts,
several of which are also subjoined.</p>

<p>The instructions for the mechanical part of the work are given on the authority of
experience, while the significations of colours and emblems have been carefully collected
from larger and standard publications.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_005.jpg" width="400" height="146" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.
</div></div>

<p>To begin with the purely mechanical part of our work, let us enumerate the materials required for
drawing the outlines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pencils.</div>

<p>3 Pencils&mdash;F, HB, and BB. 2<i>d.</i> each.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian-rubber.</div>

<p>A piece of Indian-rubber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brushes.</div>

<p>Red sable brushes; the sizes sold at 4<i>d.</i>, 6<i>d.</i>, and 8<i>d.</i> each: also 2 small sizes of the <i>best</i> Camel's
hair, 2<i>d.</i> each, necessary for Bessemer's gold paint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardboards.</div>

<p >Large sized London or Bristol board, 6<i>d.</i> per sheet, and upwards. This is a glazed (hot-pressed)
cardboard.</p>

<p>"Mounting-board" is rather cheaper, costing 6<i>d.</i> and upwards for a large sheet, but, not having so
fine a surface, will not so easily bear rubbing out. It takes colour well.</p>

<p>Pale-tinted cardboard, grey, brown, &amp;c., is sold in large sheets, at about 8<i>d.</i> per sheet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vellum-paper.</div>

<p>Vellum-paper, a good imitation of vellum, is sold at 1<i>s.</i> per sheet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tissue and
Tracing-paper.</div>

<p>Some sheets of white tissue and transparent tracing-paper; the latter for preserving copies in outline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rulers.</div>

<p>2 Rulers (flat); one of wood, about two feet long, another of bone, 6 inches; 6<i>d.</i> each (ivory, 2<i>s.</i>.).</p>

<p>A T-ruler is very useful; 1<i>s.</i> and upwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portfolio.</div>

<p>A portfolio, 2 feet by 10 inches, to hold the scrolls, would be useful in preserving them from
injury; cost, at the drawing-shops, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A list of the necessary paints will be given in the directions for colouring, <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alphabets
(capitals).</div>

<p>The beginner should endeavour to obtain one or two sheets of alphabets (capitals) in black and
white, of the full size required, say about two inches high.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lower-case
(small letters).</div>

<p>An alphabet of "lower-case," or small letters, is subjoined, which will be found to harmonise well
with almost any capitals, and is in proportion to those of two or two and a half inches high.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enlarging or
reducing
Capitals.</div>

<p>But although the beginner will do well to copy or trace letters of the exact size required, he cannot
too soon commence the practice of enlarging or reducing the copy, otherwise many very beautiful
initial letters will be lost to him. The great art in copying on a different scale is to observe carefully
the proportions of the original: keep every branch of the letter <i>equal</i> in thickness, if the original be so:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
or if copying, for example, a capital A, and one side of the arch be twice the width of the other, let
the copy preserve the same proportion. In the letter B, observe if the two bows be of equal size; the
lower is generally the larger of the two. In an equal-sided letter, like M or O, observe what
ornamental parts are opposite to each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enlarging or
reducing
Small Letters.</div>

<p>In drawing (or copying) small letters, be careful to make the stems of <i>equal</i> width or thickness, and
those which pass above or below the line of equal and proportionate height or length. The tops of
t's should always be lower than those of the other long letters, as in writing, and the dots of the i's in a
line with the tops of the t's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Books of
Alphabets, &amp;c.</div>

<p>There is a small book of medi&aelig;val alphabets, published by Masters, price 2<i>s.</i>, suited to beginners.
<i>The Book of Ornamental Alphabets, Ancient and Medi&aelig;val, collected and engraved by F. Delamotte</i>
(published by E. &amp; F. N. Spon, 16 Bucklersbury, London), is valuable to those who can enlarge while
copying; it contains upwards of forty alphabets, beginning with those of the 8th century, also several
initial letters, and a page of monograms, crosses, &amp;c.&mdash;most of the alphabets are one inch in height&mdash;price
4<i>s.</i> The best and most recent collection of letters that I have met with is <i>The Handbook of
Alphabets, Initials, and Monograms</i>, engraved by William Gibbs, published by Houlston &amp; Wright,
65 Paternoster Row, London, price 5<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Value and use
of Capitals.</div>

<p>In arranging for the outline of a text, first select the necessary capitals. The initial (or first letter)
must be the handsomest of all, as being the introduction and
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Dedication.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> dedication of the work to The Blessed
Trinity. Capitals are generally employed throughout the Sacred Names; the first letter may be the
largest, the following of the same height as the small letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emphasis.</div>

<p>They are also prefixed to such words as we wish especially to emphasize, as in the following
examples:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Be clothed with Humility.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>My times are in Thy Hand.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Watch and Pray.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The emphasis of <i>colour</i> will be given in the proper place (pp. <a href="#Page_14">14</a>, &amp;c.).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction of
Style, Date, and
Country.</div>

<p>It is advisable, if possible, to select the capitals from the same alphabet; but if all that you require
for the text do not suit your taste, there is no absolute objection to the introduction of others, subject
to certain conditions. On no account mix the letters of different countries; the Italian, for instance,
with the Saxon; they would be utterly incongruous. Also, as a writer amusingly observes, "Avoid
letting your work appear as though it had been begun in the tenth century, and only completed in the
sixteenth, or, as I have once or twice seen, <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Legibility
essential.</div>

<p>But although rules of style, date, and country, are important, they should never, in my opinion, be
carried out so rigidly as to make our work either fantastic or illegible&mdash;two very serious blemishes.
Indeed, if we sacrifice to strict chronological order all possibility of reading the letters without an
interpreter, our labour, as far as others are concerned, is worse than useless, tending to bring the whole
art into disrepute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Important Distinction.</div>

<p>Capitals with simple curves should not be mixed with those in which the curves become pointed,
the styles being distinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Best Styles.</div>

<p>The styles which prevailed from the 11th to the 14th century are considered the best, the later
ones in particular. After that date the art of illuminating gradually decayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Sketch on
Tissue-paper.</div>

<p>In proceeding to draw the outline of a text, it is a most useful practice to sketch it out roughly on
tissue-paper, in order to ascertain what space it will occupy. This plan will prevent much disappointment
(and rubbing out, which should be carefully avoided), as, even after long practice, we are often
mistaken in the supposed length of a printed sentence: nothing can look worse than one-half of the
letters spread widely over the scroll, and the rest crowded together, to make up for the room wasted
at the beginning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rules for Drawing
the Outline.</div>

<p>Having decided on the size of the initial<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and capital letters, allow a sufficient space above and
below them, and cut out the strip of cardboard by a ruled line, measured accurately at each end, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
that the width throughout shall be equal.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The spaces left above and below the <i>capitals</i> may be
equal (if for one line only), but rather less below than otherwise; 1&frac12; to 2 inches<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is a fair proportion.
In ruling for two lines of letters, be careful to leave sufficient room between them, or the y's and g's
of the upper line may interfere with the d's and h's of the lower, as also with the capitals.</p>

<p>Now, with the HB, rule two lines for the small letters, as <i>lightly</i> as possible, consistently with
clearness, as these are afterwards to be rubbed out. There is no occasion to draw an upper line for
the capitals, as they should be traced in: unless the hand be a very practised one, this method is
necessary, to avoid much disfigurement of the cardboard from corrections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To trace Capitals.</div>

<p>To trace the capitals: cut out a piece of tracing-paper, an inch or two larger every way than the
letter to be copied; rule a line on which to rest the letter, as it will be wanted afterwards; place
this over the pattern (with the ruled line close beneath it), and trace every line steadily with the HB.
This done, remove the tracing-paper, turn it over (right side downwards), and blacken all the lines with
the BB pencil. Now place the letter, right side <i>upwards</i>, on the space you intend it to occupy on the
cardboard, letting the ruled line correspond exactly with the lower line ruled on the scroll: this will
ensure the capital being quite upright in its proper position. Hold the tracing-paper down firmly with
the left hand, <i>never shifting it until the whole letter be completed</i>, and with the F pencil trace (<i>i.e.</i> go
over) every line of the copy, pressing firmly, but not so hard as to cut through the thin paper. It
may then be withdrawn, and, if correctly done, the letter will be found legibly traced on the cardboard.
It is right to finish the outline firmly (but not too dark) with the HB, as clearness is of great importance
when you are colouring.</p>

<p>Some initial letters, such as O, T, &amp;c. admit of the insertion of a small photograph of a sacred
subject, several of which can now be procured, even at one penny each. Among others may be selected
the "Ecce Homo," "The Saviour bearing the Cross," "Blessing little Children," &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Small Letters.</div>

<p>So little practice is required to draw the small letters correctly, that it is scarcely worth while to
attempt tracing them; indeed the difficulty of keeping a large piece of tissue-paper steady interferes
greatly with the chances of success. In drawing these letters (with the HB), be careful to make all the
stems of equal thickness, and let them be in due proportion, of height and width, to the accompanying
capitals. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Distances between
Letters
and Words.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>The letters should be placed as near to each other as is consistent with clearness, and about half
an inch may be left between each word: let these distances be kept uniform throughout the work. Study
to draw the letters perfectly straight and upright, to ensure which is the use of the ivory ruler, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Test of Correct
Outline.</div>

<p>Having sketched in all the small letters as well as possible, turn the strip of cardboard with its <i>end</i>
towards you, and I fear you will be shocked to see how many of the letters are out of the perpendicular.
If, however, they have not been too heavily drawn, they may now be readily corrected by the little
ruler, keeping the scroll still in the same position. The advantage of this method is, that a line which,
to an unpractised eye, will appear quite perpendicular, when turned into a horizontal position instantly
betrays its deviations. It may be objected that the use of a ruler encourages idle and careless habits,
but this is only the case when it is employed to draw by, and not, as it should be, only for correction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stops and Ornaments.</div>

<p>The ornamental stop&mdash;or perhaps a Greek cross&mdash;and any other intended additions, should be traced
now. When the hand and eye are a little practised, sprays of trefoil and similar decorations will look
more natural and easy, if drawn freshly upon the scroll. Triplets of leaves and berries have a graceful
and suitable effect, and these, in illuminations, may be drawn conventionally, rather than naturally.
A clever writer<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> says, "Rigidly avoid contrasting natural with conventional foliage. Adopt which
you like, for by either beautiful effects may be produced; but mix them, and the charm of both is
gone. Natural foliage may be successfully combined with any other varieties of conventional ornament,
excepting those based upon natural foliage."</p>

<p>The Vine Passion-flower, Ivy, or any trefoils, have a beautiful effect, if gracefully twined about,
or drooping from the initial letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Photographs in
Initial Letters,
&amp;c.</div>

<p>The introduction of small photographs (of sacred subjects) either into the initial letter, or placed
before it, with a simple border in gold, edged with blue, has often a beautiful significance and effect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Care should, however, be taken in the selection, that the picture and the sacred words subjoined have a
real connexion with each other. For example, the Magdalene at the foot of the cross is not suitable
in illustration of the text, "Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom." A square
picture may have the lines of the border prolonged so as to cross at the corners and finish about half
an inch from the principal line. An arch may be surmounted with a cross.</p>

<hr class="deco"/>

<div class="sidenote">Borders.</div>

<h3><i>Borders.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Plain.</div>

<p>To those who prefer concentrating all possible beauty of decoration on the sacred words of a text
the most approved border will be that resembling "a riband of blue," which is most simple in execution.
Rule a line rather less than a quarter of an inch from the edge of the cardboard, and fill it in
carefully and steadily with colour. The ruled line is indispensable to the preservation of a neat and
uniform edge. If blue already predominate in the scroll, red can be substituted in the border; gold,
without a coloured outline on each side, always looks indistinct. Lines of colour may be drawn within
the edge, using a reed pen (or large soft quill), and the long ruler.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ornamental.</div>

<p>A triple trefoil in each corner, coloured, with gold edge, has a good effect, if the letters are very
plain: these should, however, be <i>in addition</i> to a plain coloured edge or border.&mdash;Ornamental borders
should consist of suitable sprays wound round a thick bar, which gives an appearance of solidity, the
grace of curved lines being much enhanced by contrast with the perpendicular or horizontal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reverse Side of
Scrolls.</div>

<p>If the scroll is meant to represent a riband curled at the ends, or folded, the reverse side may be
ornamented with gold stars, or foliage. Plainly shaded blue, with perhaps a narrow gold edge, will,
however, be found most suitable; if prominent colours are gaudily used for the reverse side of the riband,
it will appear to come forward, leaving the text in the background.</p>

<p>Specimens of differently shaped scrolls are affixed to each of our chapters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Firmness essential.</div>

<p>In conclusion, it cannot be too strictly enforced, that every line, straight or curved, should be <i>firmly</i>
drawn, and the edges, in painting, be kept perfectly neat and clear. Whether from unsteadiness in
outline, or from a shaking hand when painting (especially in gold), nine-tenths of the amateur illuminations
produced have a quivering ruggedness about them which could well be dispensed with. In ornamental
finish, also, this unsteadiness is almost universal, so that the points of small leaves, or <i>fleurs-de-lys</i>, instead
of being sharply defined, most frequently degenerate into unsightly loops, similar to the following
example.</p>

<h3><i>Painting</i>.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Materials for
Colouring.</div>

<p>The materials required are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Blue.</div>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Blue</span> (intense). German (or French) blue, in powder, at 6<i>d.</i> per ounce. It is at first rather
troublesome to use, requiring to be mixed with plenty of gum-water, to prevent rubbing.</p>

<p>Smalt, 5<i>s.</i>; or French blue, 3<i>s.</i><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> These are prepared as moist colours in covered pans.</p>

<p>The German blue, however, is the most economical, and very useful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Red.</div>

<p>2.<span class="smcap"> Red.</span> What is called "Carmine" powder, at 1<i>s.</i> per oz., will be found very useful, but the
genuine colour is much more expensive. Vermilion, ditto, 6<i>d.</i> per oz. Both of these are necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purple.</div>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Purple</span> (violet). For the colour ready prepared, "violet carmine," moist cake, 2<i>s.</i> To
compose the colour, crimson lake, a little to be mixed with cobalt blue. This is very rarely used.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White.</div>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">White.</span> Chinese white, in a tin tube, 1<i>s.</i> This is little used except on tinted cardboard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Green.</div>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Green</span> (emerald). Moist colour, 1<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Black.</div>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Black</span> (lamp). Ditto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey.</div>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Grey.</span> For bright grey, smalt mixed with Chinese white; for a duller tint add a very little
brown madder. This is a colour seldom used in illuminating large scrolls, and only suitable for
grounding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neutral Tint.</div>

<p>A cake of <i>neutral tint</i> (to mix with cobalt) for shading white flowers, or a white dove.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold.</span> For beginners, "Bessemer's Gold Paint."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Bessemer's Gold
Paint. <span class="hidev">|</span></span>This includes two bottles, one of gold powder,
the other of oil; price 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The powder always outlasts the oil, but the latter can be bought
separately, 6<i>d.</i> per bottle. Very little of the powder and oil must be mixed at a time, as it dries up
very quickly, requiring the occasional addition of a drop of the oil. If too much oil is added, the gold
will look thin and poor, leaving greasy edges on the cardboard. It is a good plan to employ two
little saucers, placing the powder in one and oil in the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirits of Turpentine.</div>

<p>A small quantity of <i>spirits of turpentine</i> is required, with which the brush and saucer must be
washed perfectly clean, immediately after use; wipe them dry with a piece of rag or soft paper. If
this rule be neglected, the gold hardens, and brush and saucer become useless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shell Gold.</div>

<p>Shell gold (with which water only is employed) is not suitable for large works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liquid Gold.</div>

<p>Chinese metallic ink, or liquid gold 1<i>s.</i> per bottle, is an excellent preparation. When thoroughly
mixed by shaking, pour a little into a small saucer, stirring it up each time the brush is filled. At first,
great care is requisite to prevent blots. It works most easily when nearly dry, by the addition of a
little water in the brush.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water-gold
Size.</div>

<p>Leaf-gold is considered the most durable, is beautifully bright, and repays the trouble of its
application. A "book" containing 25 leaves costs 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or 100 leaves for 4<i>s. Water-gold
size</i> seems to be the simplest preparation, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per box. This size is used like a moist colour, with
water. Paint the surface to be gilded, smoothly and rather thickly, carefully preserving the edges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
clear and sharp. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Gold-leaf.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Let it stand until, on touching the size lightly with the finger, it is found to be sticky,
<i>but not moist</i>, so as to smear. While the size is drying, take a piece of common writing-paper (not too
highly glazed), rub it over slightly and briskly with a piece of white wax (in two or three strokes), lay
it on a leaf of gold which will adhere to the paper.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> With a large, <i>sharp</i> pair of scissors, cut both
paper and gold-leaf into a piece rather larger than the surface to be gilded, and the size being just sticky,
lay the gold down upon it, keeping the paper still in its place; press it <i>very gently</i> and smoothly all
over with a ball of cotton-wool, as if you were pasting it down: breathe on the paper, then remove
it, and let the gold remain undisturbed about half an hour, or longer. Then, with a large, dry
brush, in light, sharp touches, brush away the superfluous gold, and the work is completed.</p>

<p>There are other methods of applying gold-leaf, but this is given as the simplest. A gilder's tip (a
flat brush) is generally used, but requires skill in handling, which remark applies also to the gilder's
palette and knife.</p>

<p>Any corners to which the gold has not adhered may be retouched with the size, and gilded as
before. Be careful not to touch the gold with the fingers, or it will be quite spoilt. If the leaf curls
up upon the paper, it can be blown down with a gentle breath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Raised Gold.</div>

<p>There is an "Illuminating Raising Preparation" at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per bottle, which may be found useful,
and may be painted over with Bessemer's, or water-gold; it would, however, add to the difficulty of
applying gold-leaf, unless the hand were previously well practised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silver.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Silver</span> is sold in shells; a water-colour, but it quickly tarnishes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aluminium.</div>

<p>Aluminium is sold in shells (a water-colour), and is a good substitute for silver; although not equal
in beauty, it is said not to tarnish. Being a recent discovery, it has not yet had the test of long experience.
Aluminium is used in touches upon white flowers, or the emblem of the dove, previously softly
shaded with neutral tint. These shell metals cost about 6<i>d.</i> and upwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saucers.</div>

<p><i>Saucers</i>, 2 inches in diameter, should be procured for the red and blue powder colours. A smaller
saucer, 1 inch in diameter, for Bessemer's gold, will prevent much waste, and another for Chinese
white would be useful. Price 1<i>d.</i> each, or less.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compound Red.</div>

<p>In proceeding to illuminate the scroll, place a little vermilion-powder, and quite twice as much
carmine, in a saucer, with a drop or two of thick gum-water; mix it well with a brush, adding water
as required.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Stir the paint up now and then during use, as the vermilion has a tendency to sink.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German Blue.</div>

<p>German blue, as already mentioned, must be mixed with a good proportion of gum-water, stirred
well into the powder: it is best to mix a little at a time, say half a teaspoonful of the powder, as it
hardens, and becomes more troublesome to use. This blue, prepared as a <i>moist</i> colour, would be most
valuable for illuminating, if it did not lose its opacity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Succession of
Colours.</div>

<p>Paint all the black in the scroll first, the red next, and, if German blue, blue last, as, with every
precaution, it is apt to rub&mdash;in which case, remove the blemishes with crumbs of bread. If the text
should consist of two lines, finish the upper one first (all but the gold), to prevent injury to the lower
one by rubbing. Fresh water should be provided for each colour, in order to preserve its brightness.</p>

<p>Bessemer's gold paint may be applied last of all, but leaf-gold should be laid on before <i>any</i>
colour.</p>

<p>The following remarks on the subject of ancient illuminations are valuable, having been made by
Mr. Ruskin at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries, held on the 6th of June, 1861. He observed
that the best designs were contrived so as to give the greatest effect to arrangements of pure and beautiful
colour. He explained the excellence of the best specimens as arising from simplicity of design and
colour&mdash;<i>the latter being left wholly unclouded by shade</i>. He did not deny the high excellence of the
naturalistic treatments in the illuminations of the 15th and 16th centuries and later&mdash;but he viewed
illumination in this condition as fallen into decay, and by the introduction of <i>shading</i> was effected the
final destruction of what had constituted its essential principles and glory in the 13th century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Frames.</div>

<p>Scrolls can be very suitably mounted in frames of plain oak&mdash;"Oxford frames"&mdash;which cost
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, glass included, the size being about 22 by 6 or 7 inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Directions for
Packing.</div>

<p>For transmission by railway, &amp;c. cardboard scrolls must be protected either by a thin piece of wood
of the same size, or by two pieces of stout millboard, well wrapped round with paper. Even a dozen
large scrolls packed together have been ruined for want of these precautions.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zinc.</div>

<p class="p2">In churches where the walls are damp, or otherwise unsuited for receiving colour, it is found that
zinc is an excellent material for illuminating texts from Holy Scripture, to be fixed to the wall when
completed. This method is much less expensive than painting in fresco.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation Coat
of Paint.</div>

<p>Zinc can be procured of <i>any ordinary plumber</i>, at an average price of 10<i>d.</i> per square foot; it
requires no particular preparation for illuminating, excepting a foundation-colour (or ground), which
can be laid on by any house-painter far better than by the amateur. This should be done at the workshop,
as the smell of so large a body of paint would be very injurious to those unaccustomed to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tints to match
or contrast.</div>

<p>The foundation-colour should either match the tint of the wall to which the scroll will be affixed,
or present a decided contrast. Care must be taken in matching the colour of a plastered wall, that the
paint should be <i>lighter</i> in tint, as it has a tendency to darken, while the plaster is likely to become
rather lighter, especially in new buildings.</p>

<p>Foundation-colours, &amp;c. suitable to particular seasons of the Church will be enumerated at the end
of this article.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Size of Letters.</div>

<p>The size, shape, and length of a scroll must, of course, vary with the position it is intended to
occupy. In a text composed entirely of capitals, the size of the letters should be about half the depth
of the zinc: the latter being 6 inches, including the border, the capitals would be 3 inches high. Small
letters would bear, of course, their usual proportion, as in other illuminations. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
Distinctness.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> It is quite a mistaken
idea that the larger the printing, the plainer will be the text; clearness is rather attained by keeping
the letters close to each other, and leaving a sufficient space between each word. It will be found, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
general rule, that, with the exception of the letter I, all capitals are contained in a square&mdash;if 3
inches high, 3 wide. It is very useful to bear this in mind in calculating the number of words
to be printed in a given space, especially when it is difficult to judge of the effect till complete. Texts
for large churches, to be placed round arches, or at any great height, are generally printed in capitals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Outlines to be
traced.</div>

<p>Outlines should not be drawn upon the zinc in the first instance, but upon a strip of paper (which
may be several sheets pasted together at the edges), wider than the scroll, so that it may be folded firmly
over it, and the letters traced, as already explained (page 7). Any thin common paper answers for this
purpose: tissue would be too thin. Tracing is recommended, because the process of erasing pencil-marks,
although easily effected with spirits of turpentine, is apt to leave a smear, and spoils the smooth
clearness of the foundation-colour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chalk-tracing.</div>

<p>On a dark-coloured ground the following method is pursued. Draw the text, as usual, on common
cartridge-paper (3 or 4 inches wider than the zinc, so that the edges may be turned down firmly over
it): with pointed scissors cut the letters out and put them aside, as they are not required: lay the
remaining paper-groundwork on the zinc, and with red or white tailor's pipe-clay trace carefully
round the outlines of the spaces which form the letters. When all are traced, remove the paper,
and with a handkerchief brush away, <i>very</i> lightly, the superfluous chalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dry Foundation-Colours.</div>

<p>Special care must be taken not to begin the lettering until the foundation-colour be perfectly
hardened, otherwise the pressure of the pencil will make indented lines which cannot be removed,
should correction be necessary. In cold, damp weather, the paint dries and hardens very slowly, so
that the foundations should be prepared at least a week before they are required for illuminating.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To paint the
Letters.</div>

<p>In proceeding to paint the letters, squeeze out a small quantity of the colour on to the wooden
palette, and with the flexible palette-knife mix it with a little of the pale drying oil, and a very little
spirits of turpentine. The latter <i>can</i> be dispensed with, if the smell of it be found injurious; otherwise
it contributes to brighten the colours, and makes them dry more quickly. In painting keep the brush
full, laying on the colour in long steady sweeps, not in short, hasty touches, which would leave irregularities
of surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corrections.</div>

<p>Spirits of turpentine, used alone, will serve to remove the colour, if correction be necessary; but care
must be taken not to apply enough to remove the foundation-colour at the same time. If a wrong
colour be accidentally applied, another can be painted over it, but, of course, this should be avoided if
possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold-leaf.</div>

<p>Gold-leaf is applied in the manner already explained (page 9), but with <i>oil</i> gold-size. Plain vermilion,
used in the same way as size, is said to answer the purpose equally well. Bessemer's gold paint
only answers for a time, as it soon becomes discoloured on metal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Number of
Coats of Paint.</div>

<p>Letters painted in white will require three coats of colour; in blue and green, at least two; in
black, two coats.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Vermilion is generally brighter if laid on in sufficient quantity at once, without
retouching.</p>

<p>The writer has occasionally had the colours mixed for use by a village-painter, but this would only
be done on an emergency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Best Colours for
Effect.</div>

<p>For effect, it is best not to employ many colours; red and black, with a <i>little</i> blue or green, invariably
look best at a distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="400" height="79" alt="" />
<div class="center">Quatrefoil Border.
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Borders.</div>

<p>Elaborate borders on zinc scrolls are quite unsuitable; an edge of <i>quatrefoil</i> (three-quarters of an
inch in depth), or something equally simple, having by far the best effect; this also must not be placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
too near the letters, or it will interfere with the distinctness of the text. The border should be drawn
at the edge of the zinc, unless the ground-colour contrast with the wall, in which case a narrow margin
may be left.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To clean Palette
and Brushes.</div>

<p>The palette and brushes must be washed quite clean after daily use, with spirits of turpentine. If
the paint is allowed to harden (as it will in a few hours), it cannot be removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health.</div>

<p>For the preservation of health, this description of illuminating should, in summer, be carried on with
widely-opened windows, and in winter beside a large fire, which purifies the air of the room, and
prevents the smell of the turpentine, &amp;c. from being injurious to delicate persons.</p>

<h3><i>Colours for Special Seasons.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Advent.</div>

<p>For the season of Advent, violet ground, with red and white letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lent.</div>

<p>For Lent, a warm or pinkish-grey ground, letters all white, with black edges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Festivals.</div>

<p>Long scrolls for festivals have the best effect with white ground. Short scrolls look very handsome
with gold letters upon red or blue ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ground Tints.</div>

<p>The tint of the ground-colours must, in a great measure, depend upon the light in which they will
be seen. In some cases crimson is preferable to scarlet, and the blue or violet, if placed in a dark part
of the church, would require to be much paler than usual.</p>

<h3><i>Symbolism of Colours.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Isa. liv. II.</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="400" height="80" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours.
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Heb. x. 1.</div>

<p>I have ventured to prefix these sacred words to this part of my subject, in order to point out
how manifestly the emblematic significance of colour has its foundation and authority in the Holy
Scriptures. The fact is first brought to our notice in the inspired account of the making of the
Tabernacle, under the Divine commands, and subsequently in the building of the Temple. The colours,
numbers, and many other particulars of the Mosaic dispensation, were symbolical types&mdash;"a shadow
of good things to come," long since fulfilled; but the symbolical application of colours and other types
of "heavenly things" is not therefore ended, inasmuch as they are largely so employed throughout the
New Testament. These combined facts furnish an argument to my own mind most convincing, that
we may, with all reverence, continue to regard colours symbolically, as types of heavenly attributes
and virtues.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> says, "In very early art we find colours used in a symbolical or mystic sense, and
until the ancient principles and traditions were wholly worn out of memory, or set aside by the later
painters, certain colours were appropriate to certain subjects and personages, and could not arbitrarily be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
applied or misapplied. In the old specimens of stained glass, we find these significations scrupulously
attended to."</p>

<p>The precise tints of the colours mentioned in the Holy Scriptures must ever be a subject of doubt,
but enough can be gathered from ancient writings to bring them within certain degrees of probability.
In an interesting article in Dr. Kitto's <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Biblical Literature</i>, we read:&mdash;"Josephus
evidently takes the Hebrew word," translated "blue," "to mean 'sky-colour,' for, in explaining the
colours of the vail of the Temple, and referring to the blue (Exod. xxvi. 31), he says that it represented
the air or sky." We must not, however, be led away by our own modern term "sky-blue," which
represents a pale colour, but recollect that (to quote again from Dr. Kitto) "in proportion as the sky
is clear and serene, it assumes a dark appearance, which is still more observable in an eastern climate."</p>

<p>The blue of ecclesiastical colouring is always dark and intense.</p>

<p><i>Purple</i> is the term of most doubtful signification, being frequently applied to crimson, scarlet, and
blue. The famous "Tyrian purple" was manufactured from the juice of shell-fish,&mdash;principally the
<i>Murex trunculus</i> of Linn&aelig;us and Lamarck,&mdash;and was compared by Pliny to "the rich, fresh, and
bright colour of deep-red purple roses." The same writer observes, that "<i>violet</i>, purple, and scarlet,
were nowhere dyed so well as at Tyre, whose shores abounded with the best kinds of purples." It
seems, to my judgment, reasonable to suppose that the "purple" employed in the curtains of the
Tabernacle, &amp;c. was "violet," as that colour would best unite with "scarlet" and "blue," which are
separately enumerated. It is interesting also to read that Pliny describes "red" as distinguished from
"purple," and calls it "a gay, lively bright, approaching the colour of fire."</p>

<p>But this is a long digression; to resume:&mdash;In the Divine commands relative to the making of the
Tabernacle in the wilderness, this verse occurs (Exod. xxviii. 5), "And they shall take gold, and blue,
and scarlet, and purple, and fine linen"&mdash;that is, white. The symbolical meaning which may be
gathered from these words is very striking and beautiful. There are three colours mentioned (white is
not a <i>colour</i>); of these, two are primary&mdash;that is, original, not formed by any combination&mdash;red and
blue. Purple (or violet) is made by a combination, <i>proceeding from</i> these two; and so in these foundation-colours
of the Tabernacle, I would reverently see a symbolical representation of the Three Most Holy
Persons of the Godhead. To complete the symbol, we have also white, signifying perfect righteousness,
the emblem and colour of light; and gold, typifying glory. Thus, in the first and highest sense, are
colours symbolical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emphasis by
Colour.</div>

<p>To apply the subject to the art of illumination. It has been already remarked that the emphasis of
a text is expressed in two ways&mdash;by prefixing capital letters to the principal words, and also by
distinction of colour. On the due attention to a few simple rules respecting the value of certain colours,
and their just application, much of the beauty of an illuminated work depends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold</span> is of the highest value. It should be employed <i>only</i> for the letters forming the names of The
Holy Trinity, or Their attributes. For the sake of distinctness, however, the gold must be either
edged with blue or red, or the whole word may be placed on a tablet of colour. Sprays of
<i>fleurs-de-lys</i>, &amp;c. in red, twining between, but <i>not over</i> the letters, will also assist in making them
distinct and marked.</p>

<p>In words referring to Heaven or Angels, gold stars or dots sprinkled over the letters are
appropriate.</p>

<p>Capitals should be edged entirely, or grounded, with gold. The small letters are sometimes edged
only on one side, which gives them a raised appearance: it should be the side nearest the right hand.</p>

<p>Trefoils, and similar leaves, are generally painted in gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Blue.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Blue</span> (intense, sapphire) is of first value in colours, when used alone, but red is of equal value if
used in apposition.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is pre-eminently a colour of remembrance. The children of Israel were commanded
to wear on their garments fringes, and on the fringes "a riband of blue," that when they
looked upon it they might "remember all the commandments of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and do them,"<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and "be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
holy" unto their God. This colour being worn by express command, "signified that the wearer was
God's own,"&mdash;typifying, therefore, adoption, sonship; further, being the colour of the sky, it "reminded
Israel of his home in Heaven: so likewise in the curtains of the Tabernacle, the blue signified that hope
of Heaven which belongs to the true tabernacles of the living God, that is, to holy hearts wherein
God dwelleth."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blue</span> may be employed to represent Heaven and holy Angels; heavenly hope; heavenly rest;
holiness; consecration; truth; remembrance; adoption; peace; fidelity; constancy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Red.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Red</span> (scarlet, crimson, or ruby, the colour of fire) was anciently employed to typify the Holy
Spirit, or the Creative Power. It is thus the symbol of <span class="smcap">Divine Love</span>: including help, protection,
zeal, and similar holy attributes. As the colour of blood, it typifies <span class="smcap">REDEMPTION</span> and forgiveness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson informs us, that anciently our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and the Blessed Virgin were represented in
"the red tunic and blue mantle, as signifying heavenly love and heavenly truth. The same colours
were given to St. John the Evangelist, with this difference, that he wore the blue tunic and the red
mantle."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purple or Violet.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Purple</span> was anciently employed in religious worship both by Jews and Gentiles. So early as in the
Book of Judges (viii. 26), we read of it as forming the attire of kings; and many texts of Holy Scripture
might be adduced shewing it to be almost exclusively devoted to royalty. We read, in the
<i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> already quoted, that Pliny records a similar use of it among the Romans; and Homer
speaks of purple as if it were almost peculiar to kings. Suetonius relates that Julius C&aelig;sar prohibited
its use by Roman subjects, except on certain days, and that Nero forbade it altogether, on pain of death.</p>

<p>Purple (violet, or amethyst) signifies, therefore, first, royalty. It was also the ancient symbol of
love and truth, or passion and suffering; <a name="hence" id="hence"></a>"hence it was the colour often worn by the martyrs: in
the Spanish schools, the colour of our <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> mantle is generally a rich deep violet". In some
instances, our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, after His resurrection, is habited in a violet instead of a blue mantle. This
would, doubtless, refer to its royal, victorious signification. The Blessed Virgin is represented in
"violet, after the crucifixion"&mdash;of course in token of deepest mourning. "Mary Magdalene,
who, as patron saint, wears the red robe, as penitent wears violet and blue, the colours of sorrow
and constancy."</p>

<p>We may now easily understand why purple has been accepted as the Church's mourning colour.
Although so beautiful when represented in the clearness of stained glass, purple is but little used in large
illuminations, excepting sometimes as a ground-colour; chiefly, perhaps, because so difficult to produce
in a sufficiently bright, pure tint, as compared to the red and blue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">White</span> is essentially the emblem of light and saintly purity. Of the first, because the finest light is
white; of the second, I need hardly quote the reason,&mdash;<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
Rev. xix. 8.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> "And to her was granted that she should
be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints."</p>

<p>Typical, also, of forgiveness: <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Isa. i. 18.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow."<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
Ps. li. 7.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eccles. ix. 8.</div>

<p>The symbol also of wisdom, innocence, faith, joy, integrity, humility: of glory, perfection, and
regeneration; for white contains all colours. Solomon says, "Let your garments be always white."</p>

<p>Thus I have enumerated the colours more especially devoted to the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emerald Green.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerald Green</span> has been latterly introduced; and though, from its inferior richness when contrasted
with other colours, it should be <i>sparingly</i> employed in illuminations, it may occasionally assist in producing
a very pleasing effect, especially in floriations and ornamental stops.</p>

<p>Beautiful emblematic meanings are attached to this colour,&mdash;namely, hope in immortality, eternity,
victory. This last, because green is the colour of laurel and palm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grey.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grey</span>, the colour of ashes, anciently signified mourning, humility, and innocence accused. This
colour is sometimes employed in ground-work, not for letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Black.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Black</span> is, of course, employed only as being useful and distinct, without symbolism. It is adapted to
all words of minor importance, and to intermediate stops; also, of course, for the stalks and veins
of leaves, and stems of branches, &amp;c.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
It may not be considered irrelevant to the subject, if I subjoin an explanation of the colours
employed in the services of the Church, taken from Purchas's <i>Directorium Anglicanum</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">White.</span>&mdash;From the evening of Christmas Eve to the Octave of Epiphany, inclusive, except Feasts
of St. Stephen and the Holy Innocents. From the evening of Easter Eve to the Vigil of Pentecost;
on Trinity Sunday, Purification, Conversion of St. Paul, the Annunciation, St. John Baptist, St.
Michael, St. Luke, and All Saints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red.</span>&mdash;Vigil of Pentecost to the next Saturday; Holy Innocents (if on a Sunday), and all other
Feasts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violet.</span>&mdash;Ash Wednesday to Easter Eve; Advent to Christmas Eve; Ember Weeks in September;
Rogation Days; Holy Innocents, unless on Sunday; on Septuagesima, Sexagesima, and Quinquagesima
Sundays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black.</span>&mdash;On Good Friday, and funerals, and on public fasts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green.</span>&mdash;On all other days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cloth-of-Gold</span> is said to supply all other colours. It seems possible that this is with reference to
Psalm xlv. 9, 13.</p>

<h2><a name="EMBLEMS" id="EMBLEMS">EMBLEMS.</a></h2></div>

<div class="sidenote">St. John, xv. 5.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="400" height="90" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
I am the Vine, ye are the branches.
</div></div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to observe that the only ornamentation suitable to a text from Holy Scripture
is that which conveys to the mind some religious thought; and such thoughts are naturally suggested
by forms that figuratively represent some holy attribute or virtue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crosses.</div>

<p>The first and most obvious of Christian emblems is the Cross, that blessed form which must and
should always remind us of the inestimable price of our redemption. As such a remembrance it has
been received from the earliest ages of Christianity;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and most dear may it always prove to those who
love their <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>'s Name!</p>

<p>The almost infinitely varying forms of this sacred symbol are divided into two classes, the Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and the Greek; which distinction originated in the separation of the Eastern and Western Churches. The
Latin forms most nearly resemble the true cross, <i>i.e.</i> having the lower limb elongated&mdash;this, of course,
is received as the emblem of the Atonement: the Greek, having each of the four limbs equal in length,
is considered symbolical of the Christian religion, extending its blessed influence through all the four
quarters of the world. On this distinction of the two forms, it has been well observed that "the Latins,
who were more material in sentiment than the Greeks, preferred the <i>actual</i> form; the Greeks, more
spiritual than the Latins, idealised the reality."</p>

<p>The Western Church has generally retained the Latin form, while the Greek is more peculiar to
the Eastern branch. In all the earlier examples we read that this distinction seems to have been very
scrupulously observed.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Of Latin crosses, the principal are these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_017a.jpg" width="130" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The plain form (called in heraldry the Passion
Cross) resembling, as is generally believed, that
on which our Blessed Lord died for us. Sometimes,
when intended especially to symbolise sorrow
and suffering, the three upper arms are sharp-pointed.
The simple cross, raised on three steps,
is called the Cross Calvary, the steps being said
to typify the three Christian graces, Faith, Hope,
and Charity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_017b.jpg" width="174" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Tau Cross, resembling in shape the Greek
letter &Tau; (tau); it is also called the Egyptian Cross,
and, in heraldry, the Cross <i>Potent</i>, which is the
old English word for crutch.</p>

<p>The Cross Crosslet, of this form, on our title-page,
is taken from the seal of the Latin Convent
of St. Salvador, at Jerusalem, but the riband and
motto are adopted for the present occasion.</p>

<p>St. Philip is sometimes represented with this
cross,&mdash;on which, indeed, he is believed to have
suffered martyrdom,&mdash;and St. Anthony so generally,
that it is often called after his name.</p>

<p>Some old writers on symbolism saw in the
Tau Cross the ideal precursor of the real cross&mdash;anticipatory,
typical&mdash;the cross of the Old Testament.
It is represented also in religious art as
that on which the brazen serpent was hung.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_017c.jpg" width="158" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>St. Andrew's Cross is an emblem of humility
as well as of suffering, the Apostle being said to
have declared himself unworthy, even in death,
to approach the image of his <span class="smcap">Master</span>'s sufferings,
and therefore to have entreated that the instrument
of his martyrdom might be of a different
form. The heraldic term for this cross is <i>saltire</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_017d.jpg" width="128" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Patriarchal Cross, formerly borne by Patriarchs
and Archbishops; retained now in the
Church of Rome, and worn on the robes of Cardinals.
This cross is very common in Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
The Greek crosses are so infinite in variety, that I can only attempt to portray a very small number
of them, selecting some of the most admired.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018a.jpg" width="149" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The most familiar to English eyes is the Cross
of St. George, first impaled by Charles I.; to
this was afterwards added (on the national flag)
the white St. Andrew's, on the union with Scotland;
and later still (1801) on the union with
Ireland, St. Patrick's "red saltire." And thus
the crosses of the "patron saints" peculiar to
each kingdom became united in our national flag.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018b.jpg" width="182" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One of the best known among Greek crosses
is the Maltese, borne by the Knights of Malta.
It is often confounded with the following&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018c.jpg" width="193" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Cross Patt&eacute;e: if the outer lines are curved
inwardly, it is called a "Patt&eacute;e concave;" if
outwardly (a pretty form), "Patt&eacute;e convex."
This cross is found prefixed to old writings instead
of the words "<i>In Christi Nomine</i>."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018d.jpg" width="186" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Cross Fleury.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018e.jpg" width="181" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Cross Boutonn&eacute;e (like buds), or Treffl&eacute;e (trefoil).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018f.jpg" width="184" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Crosslet Patt&eacute;e. The term crosslet means a
little cross, and also a cross crosslet, <i>i.e.</i> a cross
with a short bar transversing each of the arms:
these are even sometimes again crossed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018g.jpg" width="193" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Cross Pommell&eacute;e (from <i>pomme</i>, an apple).</p>

<p>Some examples of both the Latin and the Greek cross are elaborately and beautifully ornamented.
It is a remark quoted on good authority, in the Magazine already referred to, that during the Middle
Ages, in the Western Church a plain cross was considered as a cross of shame, and an ornamental one
as a cross of glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
The simple Latin cross and St. Andrew's are most suitable for introduction into capital letters.
The Greek is more generally placed at the conclusion of a text, sometimes also as an intermediate stop,
or rather as a renewed dedication.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Two crosses are, in general, quite sufficient for the same text;
one as a part of the dedication, the other as a conclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dove.</div>

<p>The Dove is the well-known symbol of the Holy Spirit. When thus employed, the head should
be encircled with a Divine glory. With the olive-branch, it is the emblem of peace. The dove has
also been employed to represent simplicity and purity of heart, and in ancient times was thought an
emblem of the soul.</p>

<p>The Dove resting on the cross is a modern but beautiful combination of emblems, probably
originating in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line small">"Shouldst thou not need some mighty charm</div>
<div class="line i1 small">To win thee to thy Saviour's side,</div>

<div class="line small">The Spirit must stir the darkling deep,</div>
<div class="line i1 small">The dove must settle on the cross,</div>
<div class="line small">Else we should all sin on or sleep</div>
<div class="line i1 small">With Christ in sight, turning our gain to loss."</div>
<div class="line i10h small"><i>Christian Year</i> (4th Sunday after Easter.)</div>
</div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triangle, Trefoils, &amp;c.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Triangle</span> (equilateral), trefoil, three circles, or triple triangle, are the emblems of the Holy
Trinity.</p>

<p>Of the trefoil, which is in fact the shamrock, it is said that St. Patrick, when endeavouring to
explain the doctrine of the Holy Trinity in Unity to the heathen in Ireland, suddenly cast his eye on
the green leaves at his feet, and plucking one of them, conveyed an idea of his meaning in this simple
form.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Circle.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Plain Circle</span>, without beginning and without end, was the early symbol of eternity; united
with the cross, it typifies eternal life: enclosing a triangle, <span class="smcap">Three in One</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Serpents.</div>

<p>The serpent, with its tail in its mouth, has been justly considered an emblem of eternal punishment.
The serpent, or dragon, being always the emblem of all wickedness, is to me quite unaccountably a
favourite subject for illumination. It has, however, an obvious meaning, represented as flying <i>from</i>
the sacred words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lamb.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lamb</span> is the obvious (and very ancient) type of our Blessed <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>. It is represented with
a <i>nimbus</i>, or glory, containing four rays, one of which is concealed by the head. If each ray contains
a cross, it is called a <i>cruciferous nimbus</i>. The rays are the especial mark of a <i>Divine</i> glory, the
circlets, or glories, surrounding heads of saints and martyrs <i>never</i> including them.</p>

<p>The Lamb bearing a banner, the token of victory, is an emblem of the resurrection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pelican.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pelican</span> wounding her own breast to feed her young ones was an ancient symbol of the Great
Sacrifice. One or both of these last-named emblems are frequently met with in ancient crosses or
crucifixes, the lamb at the foot, and the pelican at the top of the cross.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Good Shepherd</span>, carrying a sheep, is also an ancient emblem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swords.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sword</span> is an emblem varying in signification according to the sharpness of its point. That
with an <i>acute</i> point is the sword of justice; with the point <i>obtuse</i>, the sword of religion; with no
point, the sword of mercy. The flaming sword typifies Divine vengeance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fish.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fish</span> is one of the very earliest symbols of our Divine Lord. The five letters of the Greek
word for a fish (&Iota;&Chi;&Theta;&Upsilon;&Sigma;) make the initials (in Greek) of the following sentence&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ, God's
Son</span>, the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> (&#7992;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf;
&Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#8056;&sigmaf; &Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8166;
&Upsilon;&#7985;&#8056;&sigmaf;  &Sigma;&omega;&tau;&#942;&rho;). "In this sense," Mrs. Jameson informs us, "we
find the fish as a general symbol of the Christian faith upon the sarcophagi of early Christians; on the
tombs of the martyrs in the catacombs; on rings, coins, lamps, &amp;c.; and as an ornament in early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Christian architecture." It was also thought an appropriate emblem of the Christian in the waters of
baptism, and in allusion to the promise, "Ye shall become fishers of men."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flaming Heart.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Flaming Heart</span> expresses fervent piety and love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anchor.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Anchor</span> is an ancient Christian emblem of firmness, hope, and patience. It is found in the
catacombs and ancient Christian gems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamp.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lamp</span>, lantern, or taper, is the old emblem of piety, celestial light, or wisdom. "For Zion's
sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go
forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth." (Isa. lxii. 1.) "Let your light
so shine before men." (St. Matt. v. 16.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lilies.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lily</span> is the emblem of the incarnation, and of purity, always placed in the hand of the angel
Gabriel, and often in the hand of the infant <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> and the Blessed Virgin; sometimes in that of St.
Joseph. <i>Lilies of the Valley</i> seem to be peculiarly fitted to represent purity and meekness combined.
<i>Violets</i> are a modern emblem of modesty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fleur-de-lys.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fleur-de-Lys</span> is considered the conventional form of the lily, and was in the Middle Ages
adopted as the emblem of the Blessed Virgin. Some see in the Mother of our Lord a type of the
Church <i>on earth</i>&mdash;see St. Matt. xii. 49, 50&mdash;which gives her emblem a much enlarged significance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Passion-flower.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Passion-flower</span> presents in itself a crowd of emblems, suggestive of the most solemn thoughts,
on which we can hardly dwell with sufficient reverence. The <i>Passiflora c&aelig;rulea</i> (common blue Passion-flower)
is thus described:&mdash;It was discovered in the Brazils, and its wonders were soon proclaimed to
Christendom as representing the Passion of our Lord, whence its present appellation. Its leaves are said
exactly to resemble the spear that pierced our Saviour's side, while the five points remind us of the five
wounds which He endured; the tendrils, the cords that bound, or the whips that scourged, Him; the
ten petals, the Apostles, Judas having betrayed, and Peter denied, Him; the pillar in the centre was the
cross or tree; the stamens, the hammers; the styles, the nails; the inner circle about the central pillar,
the crown of thorns; the radiance, the glory; the white tint, the emblem of purity; and the blue, the
type of heaven. On one of the species, the <i>Passiflora alata</i>, red spots are seen on the cross or tree.
The flower keeps open three days, and then disappears, denoting the resurrection. As a whole, the
passion-flower is an emblem of faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pomegranate.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pomegranate</span>, bursting open, and the seeds visible, was considered (in early art) as an emblem
of the future&mdash;of hope in immortality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ph&oelig;nix.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;nix</span> is an ancient symbol of immortality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palm.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Palm</span> is the well-known symbol of victory after suffering, and of heavenly bliss. Mrs. Jameson
remarks that it was the ancient classical symbol of victory and triumph, and was early assumed by the
Christians as the universal symbol of martyrdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Olive Branch.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Olive Branch</span> and the palm were very early emblems of immortality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crown.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Crown</span> is a Scriptural emblem of the Church. "Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the
hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God". (Isa. lxii. 3. See also Zech. ix. 16.)
This symbol, placed above the initial letter of a Holy Name, gives it a beautiful and marked significance.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
It may be appropriately blended with the cross; also with the palm and the lily.</p>

<p>The emblems of the four Evangelists are these:&mdash;St. Matthew, a winged man (<i>not</i> an angel);
St. Mark, a winged lion; St. Luke, a winged ox, or calf; St. John, an eagle. These symbols are
taken from the vision of Ezekiel, and from that of St. John in the Revelation.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<h3><i>Sacred Monograms.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Acts, iv. 12.</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_021a.jpg" width="400" height="84" alt="" />
<div class="caption">There is none other Name under Heaven given
among men, whereby we must be saved.
</div></div>

<p>It is surprising how much the real meaning of the letters IHS, or IHC, has been lost sight of, emblazoned
as it is on the pulpit-coverings, altar-cloths, and windows of our Churches. The interpretation
has been guessed at, or supposed to signify the initial letters of the following sentences:&mdash;"<i>Jesus
Hominum Salvator</i>"&mdash;Jesus, Saviour of men. "<i>Inspiration</i> (of the) <i>Holy Spirit</i>;" or, "<i>Jesus Humanitatis
Consolator</i>"&mdash;Jesus, Comforter of mankind. None of these interpretations are correct.</p>

<p>On the tombs of the early Christians, in the Roman catacombs, these letters (&Iota;&Eta;&Sigma;)
were sometimes
found (though not so frequently as the next monogram). They are, in the Greek character, the first
three letters of the sacred name of Jesus&mdash; &Iota;&Eta;&Sigma;&Omicron;&Upsilon;&Sigma;. The third letter, <i>sigma</i>, had in early Greek two
forms, C and &Sigma;; hence the apparent variety in what is really one and the same Monogram.</p>

<p>The second Monogram, now rarely seen, but formerly much employed in memorial inscriptions,
is called the Cross of Constantine. It consists of the two Greek characters, &Chi; and &Rho;. &Chi; stands for, or
is equivalent to, our CH; &Rho;, the Greek <i>rho</i>, is translated by our letter R: thus we have the equivalent
of the first three letters of the sacred name of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;in Greek, &Chi;&Rho;&Iota;&Sigma;&Tau;&Omicron;&Sigma;.</p>

<p>It is related, on the authority of Eusebius, that the Emperor
Constantine, while engaged in prayer, suddenly saw
this sign in the sky, and that it was also visible to his whole
army; over the sign was an inscription signifying "Conquer
by this," or, "In this sign thou shalt conquer" (<i>In hoc signo
vinces</i>). On the same night the Emperor had a dream&mdash;a
vision of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> appearing to him with the same sign,
commanding him thenceforth to bear it on his banner,
whereby he should always be victorious. In obedience to
this revelation, the Emperor immediately caused such a
banner to be constructed, and afterwards wore the sacred
sign upon his helmet. This banner was called a <i>labarum</i>,
of which we find the following brief account in Fosbrooke's
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia of Antiquities</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The name, but not the thing, commences with Constantine.
It is a standard, with a cross-piece, from which
hung a piece of stuff. The Romans borrowed it from the
Germans, Dacians, &amp;c.; and upon coins of Augustus, and
the emperors preceding Constantine, it refers to some conquered
nation. It had an eagle painted or embroidered, till
Constantine, who added the cross, monogram of Jesus Christ,
and &Alpha; and &#937;" (Alpha and Omega: see Rev. i. 8). "Sometimes,
above the flag, was a crown, in the midst of which
was the monogram mentioned. From the cross-piece hung
a square stuff, upon which Constantine placed the figures of
himself and his children in gold."</p>

<h3><i>Conclusion.</i></h3>

<p>In conclusion, I would suggest an answer to a question sometimes asked&mdash;"What is the use of
these scrolls?" The first most obvious reply might be&mdash;to place on our walls. The questioner
persists&mdash;"But why?" Let your answer be in the sense of these words: I hope thus to impress more
strongly on my mind a particular promise or commandment contained in the Holy Scriptures. I also
hope that the same effect may sometimes be produced on the hearts of others, who may often, certainly,
have read those words before, yet possibly without much thought; having them thus brought suddenly
and in a marked manner before their eyes, deeper reflection may be the profitable result. A commandment,
an injunction from <span class="smcap">God</span>'s Word, thus placed before me, may often, I trust, serve as a
check in moments of temptation. A promise I <i>know</i> to be of inestimable comfort, as the sick and the
dying have testified. <i>No</i> doubt the law of <span class="smcap">God</span> must be pre-eminently written in the <i>heart</i>,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> must
abide there as its choicest treasure,&mdash;"a well of water springing up into eternal life," nourishing the
soul at <i>all</i> times; and we have the precious gift of Him Who "bringeth all things to our remembrance."<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Yet so long as I have eyes through which I may receive holy impressions, I cannot&mdash;dare
not&mdash;despise the humblest means towards so good an end. To look upon a text of Scripture,
engraved with fair colours and emblematic adornments, gives me the same feeling of elevating
happiness, through the organ of sight, that a melodiously chaunted hymn or anthem conveys
through the organ of hearing. "The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even
both of them."<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>And to the young I would earnestly say,&mdash;cherish always a feeling of reverence on this subject
of illuminating sacred texts. Let it be considered not as a trivial, passing amusement, but, while in
practice, as a grave and steady occupation&mdash;one to which you are in duty bound, if you undertake it
at all, to give your very best attention. No work of yours&mdash;nor of any human hand&mdash;can be
worthy of the subject; in all humility and sincerity keep this truth before you. Strive to enter as
fully as possible into the meaning of the inspired words you are delineating; endeavour earnestly and
with child-like simplicity to learn the lesson they would teach.</p>

<p>Lastly, let your work be as perfect as you can possibly make it, and if the result be pleasing, render
thanks to Him who hath bestowed on you the precious talent, and from Whom all good gifts do come.
And so, "Whatsoever ye do,</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Do all to the glory of GOD</span>."</p>
